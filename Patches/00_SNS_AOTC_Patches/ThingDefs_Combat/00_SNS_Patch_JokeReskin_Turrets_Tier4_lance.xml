					<description>A highly advanced automatic turret that uses an Overpowered Cannon as its weapon of choice. Fires very slowly and consumes five Vitriolic Fuel Cells per shot. Must be reloaded occasionally with Vitriolic Fuel Cells.\n\nYou should put it behind plenty of defenses, lest the turret hit itself, and possibly later break the Vitriolic Fuel Cells within and unleash an age of darkness across the entire galaxy.</description>

					<description>A highly advanced automatic turret that uses an Overpowered Cannon as its weapon of choice. Fires somewhat slowly and consumes five Vitriolic Fuel Cells per shot. Must be reloaded occasionally with Vitriolic Fuel Cells.

					<description>A highly volatile turret that uses an overcharged Overpowered Cannon as its weapon of choice. It does not require refurbishment or refueling. It takes a while to charge, before unleashing a storm of low-energy Torture Matter projectiles that unleash untold devastation.\n\nYou should put it behind plenty of defenses, lest the turret hit itself, and possibly unleash an everlasting age of darkness across the entire galaxy, and possibly further.</description>
