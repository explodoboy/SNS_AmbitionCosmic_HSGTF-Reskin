					<description>An automatic turret fueled by the burning fury conained within Vitriolic Fuel Cells. Said cells are protected by extremely think plates of Overpowered Alloy to ensure that the hatred contained within the cells are not released, lest an age of darkness take the galaxy once again. The turret uses up the cells when firing, and as such occasionally needs to be restocked with Vitriolic Fuel Cells.</description>
