					<description>A weapon made of pure Overpowered Alloy, further empowered by Torture Liquid. It fires a massive projectile of pure Torture Liquid, utterly devastating whatever it hits. Those hit in the blast radius of the Overpowered Cannon experience untold amounts of suffering.\n\nWhile it excels at long range and extremely close range, it is highly inconsistent at medium ranges. Care should be taken with the Cannon since its explosions can accidentially destroy things.</description>
