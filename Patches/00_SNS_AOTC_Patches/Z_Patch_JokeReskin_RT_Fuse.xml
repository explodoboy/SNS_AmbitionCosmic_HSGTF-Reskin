					<description>The Overpowered Battery Gen 1 stores vast amounts of energy with the power of friendship and genuine trust.\n\nHAH! Just kidding! It bludgeons every bit of energy that comes into it, shoves it in a bag, and puts it in a tiny cell so that no energy is lost when attempting to store it.\n\nThe Overpowered Battery will never combust or explode even when damaged. It is also effectively immune to power surges, as it will simply discharge itself when a short circuit is detected.\n\nStats:\n1: Stores 10000 Watts at 100% efficiency\n2: Will dissipate 10000 Watts during short circuit (Zzztt...) events.</description>

					<description>The Overpowered Battery Gen 2 is the perfect battery, able to brutally capture very extreme amounts of energy at a time without any efficiency loss. The Generation II Overpowered Battery will never combust or explode regardless of damage or condition. It is also effectively immune to power surges, as it will simply discharge itself when a short circuit is detected.\n\nStats:\n1: Stores 100K Watts at 100% efficiency\n2: Will dissipate 100K Watts during short circuit (Zzztt...) events.</description>

					<description>The Overpowered Battery Generation Omega is the ultimate battery, 'employing' subatomic midget slaves to continually store energy. Unlike the hydroponics basins, however, the midgets will never escape. Even if the battery is destroyed.\n\nTheOverpowered Battery Generation Omega will never combust or explode no matter what, and is also effectively immune to power surges, as it will simply discharge itself when a short circuit is detected.\n\nStats:\n1: Stores 1M Watts at 100% efficiency\n2: Will dissipate 1M Watts during short circuit (Zzztt...) events.</description>
