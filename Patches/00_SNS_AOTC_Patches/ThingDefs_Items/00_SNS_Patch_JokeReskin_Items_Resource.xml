					<description>A metal-like textile woven from dense strands of Unbalancedite. It is highly resiliant, flexible, and comfortable. You can practically hear the soul trapped inside screaming, trying to escape from its eternal damnation! Don't worry, it won't escape--but if it does I pray that you can kill yourself before the ghosts can get to you, because they're *very* angry. Oh, Unbalancedite Wool can be used as leather and fabric! Great, huh?</description>

					<description>WARNING: Explosive totally-not-a-superhazard.\n\nA small cylinder of pure hatred and vitrol, with trace amounts of Torture Liquid. It's perfect for power generation and explosions! In fact, you probably should put it in a hot, poorly-ventilated room with lots of valuables and people. Especially people. Bonus points if raiders keep getting into the room with explosive weapons.</description>

					<description>A fluid excreted by the brain in situations of extreme, soul-crushing pain, both physical and emotional. The brain only produces a couple drops of it before it explodes, so to collect a meaningful amount a few ten-thousand innocent lives must be consumed. For a single unit of Torture Liquid. Fun, huh?</description>

					<description>An extradimensional matter, either collected from a universe made completely of highly dense Torture Liquid and nothing else or from harvesting billions of innocent lives. Children especially. Its properties shift with extreme ease, mostly due to the tortured trying to escape its eternal prison.\n\nIt is truly the perfect material.</description>
