					<description>A solidified nutrient-paste-like bar of protein, carbohydrates, and vitamins, amino acids and minerals prepared in a way that it won't spoil. Everything the body needs. It tastes horrible and is somehow simultaneously hard like hardtack and then is powdery when you finally are able to chew it. Most would prefer Nutrient Paste over this monstrosity.\n\nUnlike Nutrient Paste, the Nutrient Bar will not go bad or spoil, but it will still deteriorate at a very slow rate when left outside.</description>

					<description>A nutrient bar made of of protein, carbohydrates, and vitamins, amino acids, minerals, a small amount of Overpowered Alloy and Torture Liquid that won't spoil or deteriorate, primarily due to literally everything being afraid of it. It's everything the body needs, especially for torture. It tastes even worse than the nutrient bar, but everyone is too afraid to say anything.</description>

					<description>A nutrient bar made of of protein, carbohydrates, and vitamins, amino acids, minerals, a small amount of Torture Matter that won't spoil or deteriorate, as the Torture Matter obliterates whatever it doesn't like. Everything the body needs, especially for inhuman torture. It still tastes horrible, but people are scared into thinking it's actually good.</description>

					<description>A foodstuff better than even the Lavish Meal, it is improved by the properties of Overpowered Alloy and Torture Liquid to make a truly horrifying meal that will never spoil. The tortured nature of the food makes nature not want to touch it, and as such it deteriorates at a slower rate.\n\nIt actually tastes pretty good... If you think pure agony tastes good, of course.\n\nWhich you do, because you downloaded and activated this mod.</description>

					<description>The number one choice of masochists, this meal is seen nowhere but within the borders of Torture Liquid Union empires--the only empires large and rich enough to harvest billions of innocent lives each day to produce Torture Matter. These meals never spoil or deteriorate due to the sheer horror that is this meal, ensuring nature will salt its own earth to never have to lay its many eyes on this monstrosity ever again.</description>
