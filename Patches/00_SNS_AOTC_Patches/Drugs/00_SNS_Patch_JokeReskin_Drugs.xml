                            <description>A nanite-based 'drug' that ####### obliterates all disease that attempts to enter the body. Driven by the endless fury of the countless lives consumed to make the Torture Matter that fuels it, it will destroy everything it can before it loses cohesion and dies.

						<value>
                            <description>An ambrosia-flavored beverage. Lux provides an initially powerful euphoria that lasts a few minutes, before quickly transforming into a horrific high that threatens the user into being happy for about eighteen hours. The memory-cleansing agents prevents the user from preparing for the storm, so it works just fine every time!\n\nIt is banned in almost every non-Torture Liquid Union empire's territories.\n\nIt is one of the favorite tools of the upper-class for Torture Liquid Union empires, who extensively use Lux to keep their many, many slaves and lower-class 'citizens' in check.</description>

                            <description>A terrifying beverage filled with Torture Matter-powered nanites. Hedonia's name does not fit its effects in the slightest. Hedonia is a powerful emotion-suppresser, achieving this by creating a pocket dimension in your brain, where the user's emotions are transformed into 'people', before being tortured for a period of three days.</description>

                            A nanite stimulant. STIM-VII reduces the user's need for sleep drastically by acting out the processes that cause restfulness in the brain, naturally reducing the need for sleep without risk of a crash. The effects last for two days. There is no risk of addiction from use of STIM-VII. Up to four doses can be taken at once for a maximum duration of eight days.\n\nSTIM-VII is seen occasionally on Glitterworlds, imported directly from an Abyssal Empire. STIM-VII sees heavy use in various militaries due to it being incredibly effective for reducing soldier sleep times and allowing one to stay awake for highly extended periods of time.</description>

                            <description>A Torture Matter-powered nanite stimulant. STIM X completely removes the need for sleep for an entire day, by engaging in glorious battle with the RimWorld source code for that day to prevent it from realizing that it needs to reduce the 'Rest' value for the user. Multiple doses of STIM-X can be taken for its crusade against programmers to last longer, up to twenty-five days.</description>
