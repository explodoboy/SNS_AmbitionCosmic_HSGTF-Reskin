<description>This mod is a reskin of Ambition of the Cosmic. It transforms you into an awful person in a hilariously dark universe.

There is no lore. At least, not from the base AOTC. HSGTF opens a new world, completely unrelated to that of AOTC. In HSGTF, you're harnessing literal hatred, vitriol, and torture to ascend to the greatest level of all, built atop a vast empire of incomprehensible pain!

Additionally, the fourth wall only exists when I (the mod author) want it to. Descriptions and names for things may, at any time, feature me, the mod author, insulting you, threatening you, coming out of your monitor/screen to good on said threats, and more. Sometimes it's serious, too!

On the topic of threats, I better not hear any criticism about my laziness around giving this reskin textures. I will pour Torture Liquid down your ears if you do so. And, no, you're not getting any context on what that is. Do your own research.
